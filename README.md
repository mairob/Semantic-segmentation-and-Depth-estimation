# Semantic-segmentation-and-Depth-estimation
Semantic segmentation and depth estimation with hardware restricted fully ConvNets (FCNs) for autnomous driving.

## General
This repository should do two things: 1) show that it is possible to do dense prediction tasks with limited hardware on huge state-of-the-art datasets and get utilizable reults. 2) provide code examples that are kept easy to understand and meant to re-use for different projects involving FCN
